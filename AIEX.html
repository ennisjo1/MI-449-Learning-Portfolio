        <p class="page_paragraph"> When beginning task Week 7.5's Lab Assignment, I was faced with the dilemma of how to implement the use of LLM in my coding efforts. This, like many problems in school, web development, and life was brought to our attention without clear instruction on "how to". In the absence of a singular source of truth, and a clear path to follow, we as students, and more broadly humans, must find a way to make best use of our time in the limited capacity of our time.	By and large the tool’s were inconclusive, in some cases they responded well to my questions and others they were simply unable to provide me with a result that led to any positive outcome. The LLM (ChatGPT 4.0) was very valuable when asked “Render two different endpoints on your main HTML page and style them using Tailwind.” It deciphered the questions, solved the problem, and communicated a solution to the issues within the JavaScript, using the X-data feature. This surprised and encouraged me. The tool was limited in that it failed to produce an effective solution when asked “Why does click me not appear as a full button”, the model failed. In that it misguided me, by providing advice that had little to do with the problem I outlined. In some places my code was left over remnants from other work and the model could do little to point out my code’s inefficiency. In practicing with the LLM’s I learned some of the functionality of the tool and remain eager to learn further how it’s designed and how it can promote best practices of our discipline. </p>
